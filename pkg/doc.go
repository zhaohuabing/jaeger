// Package pkg is the collection of utility packages used by the Jaeger components without being specific to its internals.
//
// Utility packages are kept separate from the Jaeger core codebase to keep it as small and concise as possible. If some utilities grow larger and their APIs stabilize, they may be moved to their own repository, to facilitate re-use by other projects. However that is not the priority.
